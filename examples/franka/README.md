# $\pi_{0.5}$ for Franka
In this project, I finetune $\pi_{0.5}$-DROID on my own Franka dataset, 
collected by the [lerobot_franka_isoteleop](https://github.com/Shenzhaolong1330/lerobot_franka_isoteleop.git) project. The dataset is in the format of Lerobot V3.0.

## Env Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Shenzhaolong1330/openpi-franka.git

# Or if you already cloned the repo:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Add the dependencies you need:

You can add the dependencies you need in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) `[project] dependencies` section.

For me I need the following dependencies:
```toml
"pyrealsense2",
"zerorpc",
```

As for [lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot), you can add in the `[tool.uv.sources]` section.

The default version of lerobot installed by `openpi` is a very old version and the data format is not compatible with the latest version.
So we need to install a proper version of lerobot manually.
Here I chose the version `da5d2f3e9187fa4690e6667fe8b294cae49016d6` which is the version compatible with data collected by [lerobot_franka_isoteleop](https://github.com/Shenzhaolong1330/lerobot_franka_isoteleop.git).

As I have installed the proper version of lerobot in my computer, I can add local path of lerobot in the `[tool.uv.sources]` section.
```toml
lerobot = {path = "/path/to/lerobot"}
```

### 3. Env management

Create a conda environment for this project:
```bash
conda create -n openpi_franka python=3.11
conda activate openpi_franka
```
Install `uv` in the conda environment:
```bash
pip install uv
```
and install the dependencies in the conda environment:
```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv pip install -e .
# If above command failed, try the following command:
# GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300 uv pip install -e . --index-url https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

Install packages needed: 
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y ffmpeg libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev
ffmpeg -version
```

## Config Franka Trainer

This part configures the model, dataset, and parameters for training, and other hyperparameters.

Remember to set your own datasets in the `repo_id` field, and  `weight_loader` to your own checkpoint.

## `data_loader` Reorder `observation.state` and Compute the State Norm

In my own datasets, the `obs.state` is not only the concatenation of the joint angles and the gripper position, but also contains the velocity of the joints and other information.
To match the format of the pretrained models, we need to reorder the `observation.state` to be `[joint_position, gripper_position]`.

I added the following code to reorder the `observation.state` in the [data_loader.py](src/openpi/training/data_loader.py) `create_torch_dataset()`.
<!-- ```python
# data reorder
    def reorder_state(example, indices):
        state = example['observation.state']
        if max(indices) > len(state) or min(indices) < 1:
            raise IndexError(f"indices {indices} out of range for observation.state of length {len(state)}")
        example['observation.state'] = [state[i-1] for i in indices]
        return example

    obs_indices = os.getenv("OBS_INDICES")
    if obs_indices:
        indices = list(map(int, obs_indices.split(",")))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Environment variable OBS_INDICES not set for reordering observation.state")
    print(f"Reordering state with indices: {indices}")
    print(f"Reordering state with names: {[dataset_meta.names['observation.state'][i-1] for i in indices]}")
    dataset.hf_dataset = dataset.hf_dataset.map(lambda ex: reorder_state(ex, indices=indices))
    print("Finished reordering state.")
    if data_config.prompt_from_task:
        dataset = TransformedDataset(dataset, [_transforms.PromptFromLeRobotTask(dataset_meta.tasks)])
``` -->

For computing the state norm, we need to set the `OBS_INDICES` environment variable to `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9` (the indices of the joint positions and gripper position).
```bash
# OBS_INDICES is the indices of the joint positions and gripper position in the observation.state
# --config-name is the name of the config name in the config.py
OBS_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name pi05_droid_finetune_franka
```
The computed state norm is saved in the `norm_stats.json` file in the dataset directory.

## Finetune the Model

I collected 50 training trajectories for finetuning the model.

```python
OBS_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py pi05_droid_finetune_franka --exp_name=pick_cube_into_box_20251222_v01 --overwrite
```

## Inference the Model
Remember to change the dataset path in the local machine (in [config.py](src/openpi/training/config.py) `TrainConfig`) to the path of your own dataset and sync the `norm_stats.json` file. Cause the `norm_stats.json` file is usually computed in the cloud.

```pythonc
uv run examples/franka/inference_pi_with_franka.py
```
